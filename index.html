                            This is a project I worked at the end of winterim to automate the process of searching for empty seats during the Dartmouth Add/Drop period. The program scans the online timetable, and texts the user when a spot opens up. Click here to see the GitHub repo!

                            This is my most recent project at Dartmouth Formula Racing. It translates analog and digital sensor readings into messages that can be transmitted over the industry standard CAN protocol. Click here to see the GitHub repo!

                    At DFR I work on the grounded low-voltage (GLVS) team. This involves gathering sensor data, transmitting data around the car, and controlling the motor and engine.

                    During the warm months of the year I kayak and canoe with Ledyard whenever I have free time! I frequently go whitewater kayaking in at the Hartlands rapids, and am going on whitewater kayaking in Virginia this March!

                    As a member of the mountain biking club (DMBC) I frequently go biking at the Oak Hill recreation area on some of the trails that the club maintains. I'm hoping to go on a break trip with them next year once I have some more experience!
