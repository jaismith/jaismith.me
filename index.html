                    At DFR I work on the grounded low-voltage (GLVS) team. This involves gathering sensor data, transmitting data around the car, and controlling the motor and engine.

                    During the warm months of the year I kayak and canoe with Ledyard whenever I have free time! I frequently go whitewater kayaking in at the Hartlands rapids, and am going on whitewater kayaking in Virginia this March!

                    As a member of the mountain biking club (DMBC) I frequently go biking at the Oak Hill recreation area on some of the trails that the club maintains. I'm hoping to go on a break trip with them next year once I have some more experience!
